This is code for a project I did in my Systems Programming class. The game matches two opponents over the internet to a game of Nim. Once the nim_server is run, the Nim client can be run and the server forks off to a nim_match_server for each game that is being played. The code was made to run on William and Mary's Lab Machines. It can only connect opponents that are using those machines.
